# MemoNexus Project Rules

You are developing MemoNexus, a local-first personal database.
Always refer to the files in `/specs` before writing code.

## Core Constraints:

1. **Logic Location**: All business logic (scraping, TF-IDF, S3 sync) MUST be in the `internal/` directory (Go).
2. **Offline-First**: Use SQLite FTS5 for all search queries. Do not assume internet access for core functions.
3. **Data Integrity**: All tables must use UUID v4 as Primary Keys.
4. **Platform Bridge**: Use Dart FFI for Mobile-to-Go communication.

## Implementation Flow:

- When asked to build a feature, first update/check the corresponding spec in `/specs`.
- Ensure Go logic is testable via `go test`.
